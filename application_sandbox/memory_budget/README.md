# Memory Budget

This sample renders a rotating cube on the screen and prints out memory budget
information about each heap to the console. The use of the memory budget
extension is enabled by requesting the instance extension
`VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` and the device extension
`VK_EXT_memory_budget`.
