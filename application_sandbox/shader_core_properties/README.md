# Shader Core Properties

This sample renders a rotating cube on the screen and prints out the shader core
properties to the console. The use of shader core properties is enabled by
requesting the instance extension `VK_KHR_get_physical_device_properties2` and
the device extension `VK_AMD_shader_core_properties`.
